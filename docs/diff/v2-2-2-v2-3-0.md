# Differences between V2.3 and V2.2.2

SPDX 2.3 has added new fields to improve the ability to capture security
related information and to improve interoperability with other SBOM formats.

Key changes include:

- Added fields to Clause 7 ( Package Information ) to describe
  "Primary Package Purpose" and standardize recording of "Built Date",
  "Release Date", "Valid Until Date".

- Added hash algorithms (SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, BLAKE2b-256,
  BLAKE2b-384, BLAKE2b-512, BLAKE3, ADLER32 ) to the set recognized by 7.10
  (Package Checksum field) and 8.4 (File checksum field)

- Update Clause 7, 8, and 9 to make several of the licensing properties
  optional rather than requiring the use of "NOASSERTION" when no value is
  provided.

- Update Clause 11 to add the new relationship types:
  REQUIREMENT_DESCRIPTION_FOR and SPECIFICATION_FOR.

- Update Annex B ( License matching guidelines and templates ) to use the
  License List XML format

- Update Annex F ( External Repository Identifiers ) to expand security
  references to include advisory, fix, URL, SWID.
  Expand persistent identifiers to include gitoid.

- Update Annex G ( SPDX Lite Profile ) to include NTIA SBOM mandatory minimum
  fields as required.

- Update Annex H to documented how the snippet information in files to be
  consistent with REUSE recommendations.

- Added Annex K ( How To Use SPDX in Different Scenarios ) to illustrate
  linking to external security information, and illustrate how the NTIA SBOM
  mandatory minimum elements map to SPDX fields.
