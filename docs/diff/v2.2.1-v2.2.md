# Differences between V2.2.1 and V2.2

There were no technical differences;
V2.2.1 is V2.2 reformatted for submission to ISO via the PAS process.

As a result, new clauses were added causing the previous clause-numbering
sequence to change.
Also, Annexes went from having Roman numbers to Latin letters.

Here is the translation between numbering in V2.2.1
and the version that came before it:
