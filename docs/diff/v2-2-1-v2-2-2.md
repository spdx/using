# Differences between V2.2.2 and V2.2.1

SPDX 2.2.2 fixed formatting, grammatical and spelling issues found
since ISO/IEC 5962:2021 SPDX V2.2.1 was published.

No new fields were added.

Key changes include:

- Clarify Optional Cardinality contradictions
- Update OWL document
- Update JSON schema to fix typos and add missing required fields.
- Clarify Information on using License List short form identifiers.
- It fixed annex lettering inconsistencies.
  It also moved CC-BY-3.0 to the end of the spec to keep annex letters more
  consistent in future versions.
  
Here is the translation between lettering in V2.2.2
and the version that came before it:
