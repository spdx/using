# Differences from V2.2 and V2.1

- JSON, YAML, and a development version of XML have been added as supported
  file formats.

- A new appendix "SPDX File Tags" has been added to describe a method that
  developers can use to document other SPDX file-specific information
  (such as copyright notices, file type, etc.) in a standardized and easily
  machine-readable manner. See Appendix IX for more information.

- A new appendix "SPDX Lite" has been added to document a lightweight subset of
  the SPDX specification for scenarios where a full SPDX document is not
  required. See Appendix VIII for more information.

- Additional relationship options have been added to enable expression of
  different forms of dependencies between SPDX elements. As well, NONE and
  NOASSERTION keywords are now permitted to be used with relationships to
  indicate what is unknown.

- Miscellaneous bug fixes and non-breaking improvements as reported on the
  mailing list and reported as issues on the spdx-spec GitHub repository.
